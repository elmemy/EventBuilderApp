# Dependency Injection README

Dependency injection is a design pattern used in the project to enhance flexibility, modularity, and testability by decoupling components and their dependencies. In this project:

- **CategoriesService** and **ItemsService** classes utilize dependency injection by accepting a network service (`NetworkServiceProtocol`) as a parameter in their constructors.
  
  ```swift
  init(networkService: NetworkServiceProtocol) {
      self.networkService = networkService
  }
  ```

- This approach allows different implementations of the network service to be injected into the services, facilitating easier testing and flexibility. For example, mock implementations of the network service can be injected during unit tests to isolate the services from external dependencies.

- By adhering to the dependency injection principle, the project promotes loose coupling between components, making it easier to replace or mock dependencies when needed.

- Overall, dependency injection enhances the maintainability and testability of the project by making component dependencies explicit and easily substitutable.
