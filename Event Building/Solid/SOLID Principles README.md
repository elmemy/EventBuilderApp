# SOLID Principles README


The codebase adheres to SOLID principles:
Certainly! Here's how you could explain the adherence to SOLID principles in the README file:

## Adherence to SOLID Principles

The project adheres to the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class within the codebase is designed to have a single responsibility. For example:

- The `CategoriesService` class is responsible for fetching categories from the network.
- The `ViewModel` class handles the presentation logic and state management for views.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Classes are designed to be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows for easy addition of new features without altering existing code. For instance:

- New functionalities can be added to the `ViewModel` class by subclassing or implementing protocols without modifying its core implementation.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes are designed to be substitutable for their base types, enabling polymorphic behavior and flexibility. For example:

- Any subclass of the `Category` class can be used interchangeably with the base `Category` class.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Interfaces are segregated to define specific contracts, promoting loose coupling and modularity. For example:

- The `CategoriesServiceProtocol` defines a specific contract for fetching categories, ensuring that implementing classes only need to provide the required functionality.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations, facilitating easier testing and flexibility. For example:

- The `ViewModel` class depends on abstractions such as the `CategoriesServiceProtocol`, allowing different implementations of the service to be injected at runtime.

By following these SOLID principles, the project maintains a clean, modular, and extensible architecture, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time.
